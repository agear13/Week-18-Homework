I created a private blockchain network called Zbank which is running on the Ethereum network. 

First steps:

Activate New Python 3.7 virtual ethereum environment (conda create -n ethereum python=3.7 anaconda )
Activating the environment (conda activate ethereum)
Download and install the web3.py module (pip install web3)
Install the bit module (pip install bit)
Installing MyCrypto Desktop App (https://download.mycrypto.com)
Installing Go Ethereum Tools (https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/)
(Troubleshooting)
Install Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools In Windows
In some cases, the Web3.py library may fail to install in Microsoft Windows due to the need for Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools. In such an event, following the below steps to resolve the issue:
Go to: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
Scroll down the page and click on "Tools for Visual Studio 2019" to reveal the sub-options.
Download the "Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019" package.
Run the package file and select the C++ build tools option. Then click install.

The screenshots display the creation of the Genesis block which was created with Puppeth. 

Two nodes were created and initialised. 

Unfortunately, I could not send a test transaction because I could not get test ETH.
